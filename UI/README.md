## Features

### UINavigator

The `UINavigator` is a comprehensive UI framework that provides a structured way to manage different UI elements within your game. It offers:

-   **Screen Management**: Implement stack-based navigation for game screens, allowing for smooth transitions between different views with push and pop operations.
-   **Alert System**: Display customizable alert dialogs to the user, supporting various button configurations and callback actions.
-   **Modal Popups**: Manage modal windows that block interaction with the underlying UI, often used for settings, inventory, or confirmation dialogs.
-   **Toast Notifications**: Show temporary, non-intrusive messages to the user, ideal for feedback or brief informational alerts.
-   **Tooltip System**: Create dynamic tooltips that can be positioned relative to other UI elements, providing contextual information on demand.
-   **Animation Transitions**: Utilize a robust animation system for all UI components, allowing for customizable show and hide animations using ScriptableObjects and DOTween.
-   **Addressable Assets Integration**: Seamlessly load UI prefabs using Unity's Addressable Asset System, improving asset management and build times.
-   **Tab System**: Basic implementation for managing tabbed interfaces, allowing users to switch between different content panels.
